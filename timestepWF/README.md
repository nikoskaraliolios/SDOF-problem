# Application of the Weak Formulation in each timestep


This is an implementation of the weak solution of the SDOF (Single Degree of Freedom) problem in Python.
It is the first of two algorithms, and in this version the WF is applied to each timestep (instead of
the whole interval where the solution is sought).

TODOs: Cythonize and Parallelize the algorithm.
